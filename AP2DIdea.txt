High level ideas

Imagine the laws of physics don't exist - go back to the laws of physics and create weird situations on what people though was true, ex everything revolveda round the world not the sun
Fractals
Other dimensions
Portals
Infinity
Non-euclidean
Zooming out to reveal more of the same thing (kinda fractals)
Eschers works were sometimes based on impossible objects and extended
Tessellation
Opacity screws up the perception of layering
Using a video then taking still shots and modifying their opacity
Lots of reflection
To create higher dimension geometrical objects, just double the previous dimension and connect them
Dimensions, 1, 2, 3, 4 which is time, 5 which is time with no shortcuts (parallel universes exist here), 6 but all paralell universes must have same beginning (big bang) and has shortcuts, 7 is free from the same beginning requirement and can have infinite forms of itself (fun fact rick and morty can travel in 7th dimension), 8th is all present past and futures and extends to infinity string theory says objects dont exist here, 

Ideas

4 cubes each with 4 of the same person all reaching towards each other
Infinite loop with person stuggling to walk - shows how we strive to move foward but hedonically adapt, wejust walk in a circle
Really long bus
Person walking on infinitely long trail
Person trying really hard pushing a block that is actually connected to them
Circle of stairs with person walking on it while carrying something heavy
Impossible machine, power generating
The idea of the universe revolving around the world
Cube thats falling down but camera rotates to look up and loops and looks at cube falling down again, infinitely falling cube
Infinite staircase
Wormhole and taking the stortest path
A dot that turns out to be a line in 2d, which that turns out to be a plane, which turns out to be a cube, and so on and so on
Great Rhombicosidodecahedron (youtube video)
A stairwell from inception but it is infinite and reveals at the end it is broken and then continues going up even higher
A tesselation in 2d which is then viewed from 3d which then is viewed in 4d
A picture depciting the same person with 2 seperate wives, which depicts time in the 5th dimension. Could be like an image cut in half vertically which on the left depicts the decision and on the right depicts 2 differnet outcomes. This would represent 5th dimension time. Also this idea could be done with any other impactful decision, not just the wife. Death could be interesting.
