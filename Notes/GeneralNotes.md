# General Notes
Sustained Investigation - Impossible geometry

## Questions
- Can math be incorporated into art?
- Can 3d software be used to create new mind-bending art?
- Can confusing art be interesting?
- What are the differences between logical art pieces and illogical pieces?
- Does art need to guide the eye?
- How easily can our perception be confused?

## Questions to self
- Does art need to guide people's eyes to look good (ex. before 27:04 of Level design in impossible geometry)
- 

## Other
- Many of these games focus on 1 specific idea
    - Superliminal = perspective
    - Portal = portal
    - Manifold garden = portals & infinity & physics
    - Antichamber = portals & buffer & changing things on where you look & perspective
    - Inception = perspective
- Antichamber may be a good idea to play again because of the little snippets it gives
